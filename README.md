Experiment with data compression

Infinite Lossless Data Compression Program Created

(Source Code and Implementation in Python)

Overview

A novel data compression method has been developed, enabling recursive lossless data compression. This breakthrough technique allows for radical reductions in data storage and processing requirements. The system relies on a dynamic fourth-level dictionary, where binary sequences are encoded with labels, which are recursively compressed.

How It Works

This method is based on recursive binary encoding:

Raw binary sequences are split into pairs.

Each pair is replaced with a unique label.

Labels are grouped and re-encoded with higher-level labels.

The process continues until reaching the 900 GB dictionary limit.

Decompression follows the reverse process, ensuring full data recovery.

The theoretical foundation is based on Claude Shannon’s information entropy principles. Unlike traditional algorithms (e.g., LZW, Huffman), this approach utilizes multi-layered encoding, allowing data to be compressed beyond conventional entropy limits.

Testing Results

Tests conducted on Google Colab:

100 GB of data successfully compressed to 1 GB.

Data fully restored without loss.

ZIP/RAR achieves an additional 10-20x compression over this method.

Optimization Goals

Rewrite in C++ or CUDA for 40-80x speed improvements.

Optimize memory usage – current implementation requires 34 GB RAM; SSD-based handling is needed.

Implement recursive compression post-processing to achieve further reductions.

Potential Applications

Transform any device (PC, smartphone) into a high-efficiency server.

Recursive computation acceleration via JIT compilation.

AI model compression and execution speed boost by thousands of times.

Advancing AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and accelerating technological singularity.
