**BUTT JOINT?**

I begin by removing the old product using a green cone bit with a 50 diameter. I set my e-file to the maximum speed, which for me is 45,000 RPM.

First, I shorten the length on all the nails. If you need to remove a lot of length, it's faster to trim it with nippers first and then file down the remainder with the bit.

I start removing the product with diagonal strokes from the right corner towards the middle of the nail, and then repeat the same diagonal strokes on the left corner. This technique is very fast because these initial diagonal movements immediately take off most of the thickness from the free edge. After that, I use a top-to-bottom motion to remove the remaining thickness in the center.

Once the excess bulk is gone, I smooth the nail surface using the entire face of the bit with right-to-left motions. If there is any lifting, always file around its contour. Don't file on top of the lifted area itself; instead, carefully "trim" around the edge with the bit and gently pry it to make it pop off.

A key point for speed: to remove thickness quickly, keep the bit in constant contact with the nail. When you lift the bit and use gliding motions, you are smoothing the surface, which removes very little product.

After removal, the nails should have a minimal, thin layer of the old material left.

Now, let's prep the cuticle. I thoroughly open the cuticle pocket, moving in small steps from the right sinus to the left. It's important to start from the sinus area. After pushing everything back, I check my work by gliding a pusher under the cuticle without applying pressure. This also helps remove any leftover pterygium. If the pusher gets stuck anywhere, it means the cuticle in that spot isn't pushed back enough. A well-prepped cuticle will show a clean, even shadow underneath, with no stuck areas.

For my model’s moist skin, I use baby powder. It absorbs moisture and makes e-file work easier on a dry surface.

Now, for the surface filing. I buff the nail plate to remove the last remnants of old product, working from left to right. Move in one direction in sections; file a strip, move to the right, file the next. Try not to go back and forth. My movements are brisk and light because there’s not much material left and I don't want to over-file the natural nail.

Next, we shape the free edge. It's crucial before an extension service to file the length down to zero and completely remove the corners, otherwise, they will interfere with form placement. I do this in one continuous motion: I file off the length from the center, then immediately move into the right corner, and then the left. This way, everything is done at once.

For the first time during the manicure, I now brush off all the dust and powder, sweeping towards the cuticle. This action has a dual purpose: it cleans the nail and helps to further open up the cuticle pocket, allowing any trapped dust to fall out.

This is what the nail should look like after this prep stage: a minimal amount of old material remains, the length is filed down to zero, and there are no sharp corners.

**FLAME BIT**

In my manicure technique, I work at fairly high speeds. The main thing is to work quickly and without any pressure; then, it will be safe. I set the speed to about 20,000 RPM.

Starting from the growth point, I move towards the sinus with top-to-bottom motions. Don't forget the pterygium. Clean the sinus area thoroughly, and only then, reposition your hand to work from the left sinus to the right, cleaning everything under the cuticle. Immediately after this, I use a circular motion to polish the sidewall.

If you typically work at low speeds, increase your RPMs gradually. Don't jump to maximum speed on your first client if you're used to the minimum. The bit I use is an elongated 2.3mm flame bit. I like it because it has a large surface area, which saves time. I also really like that the widest part of the bit, its 'belly,' is positioned lower down. This will help you minimize injuries in the sinus areas.

Also, pay close attention to the fact that I never go backward. Once I start moving up the sidewall, I don't go over that same spot twice. It's better to stay in one area a little longer and get it perfect than to go back and forth ten times. When I'm working, I look directly into the nail groove; I need to see everything clearly. We must always pull back the sidewall when cleaning the lateral grooves, the sinus, and under the cuticle.

Now, for the second time during this manicure, I remove the dust.

Before working on the left groove, I move the client's hand to the right, away from me, and I shift my own position to the left. We work in the same way, only now we move from the sinus towards the growth point.

I use sweeping motions, cleaning everything thoroughly at once, not forgetting the pterygium. And again, notice, I am not going backward. I would rather stay in one spot longer than frantically jump around the grooves ten times. I always pull the sidewall up to see everything under the cuticle. Then, I pull the skin back in the sinus area to see everything there.

The bit should lie flat against the nail plate to avoid creating grooves or over-filing. You need to use sweeping motions, as if you're sweeping away all the dust with the bit itself. And of course, work with a dust collector; without one, you'll have to clean the dust repeatedly.

I clean the sinus, clean the groove, and then polish the sidewall. At this point, you must have removed all the pterygium and thoroughly cleaned the grooves.

Here is what our intermediate stage looks like. Looking into the nail folds, we should see a single, smooth, uninterrupted shadow. This indicates that the manicure has been done cleanly. By this stage, you should have removed all the pterygium, cleaned the grooves, and polished the sidewalls.

**NAIL PLATE PREPARATION**

I prep the nail plate in two stages.  
First, I thoroughly cleanse each nail, wiping it as if I were removing nail polish.

After that, I wrap a lint-free wipe around an orange wood stick and clean out the nail folds to remove any remaining dust.

Next, I use a dehydrator. I apply the dehydrator with random motions, making sure to cover the nail and it's okay if it gets on the surrounding skin. I might even use the brush to sweep a little more dust out of the nail folds.

I apply the primer with a well-wiped brush, without layering it. Watch how I do it.

Notice that I don't go over the same spot twice. If a small bare patch remains, it's not a big deal.

I don't like working with base coat straight from the bottle, so I always pour it into small pots.

I apply a thin, slip layer of base coat to all five fingers at once, paying special attention to the areas near the nail folds and the cuticle. There should be no bare spots left in these areas.

If you are worried about the thumb curing properly, you can cure it separately for 30 seconds.

Okay, now let's talk about the landmarks for placing nail forms.

The first thing we use as a guide is the **central axis of the finger**. This is a line drawn through the center of all the phalanges, excluding the last one, because our final phalanx often curves to the side, up, down—anywhere but straight.

This is what the axis on the index finger looks like. Notice that the nail itself grows off to the side relative to this central axis. Why does this happen? Our nail form also has vertical markings and a main, bold vertical line. When placing the form, this line should align with the central axis of the finger. But there are exceptions: if the nail itself grows significantly to one side and we place the form perfectly along the finger's central axis, we'll get a picture like this.

I've drawn it here, look – in this spot, there won't be enough material, and the nail will crack. And in this spot, you'll get a dip that will be difficult to fill later.

But if we place the form along the central axis of the nail itself, the whole extension will come out crooked.

So what's the solution in this situation? We need to find a **midline** – I’ve highlighted it in blue – and align the center of our form to that line. It's located between the central axis of the finger and the central axis of the nail. This way, we slightly straighten the nail's appearance while keeping it strong and beautiful.

Besides the finger's central axis, we have another landmark: the **lateral axis of the finger**. This works similarly, but we are looking at the finger from the side and drawing a line through the center of the phalanges, again, excluding the last one.

When looking at the form from the side, we also see lines, but now they are horizontal. These lines must be parallel to the lateral axis of the finger. This is called **straight form placement**, and you've likely heard of it before.

Let's look at the **Square** and **Coffin** shapes. They have two main differences. The first, of course, is that a Square has two straight, parallel sidewalls. A Coffin (or tapered square) also has straight sidewalls, but they taper towards the tip, meaning they are no longer parallel to each other.

From the side view, the shapes also have differences. With a Square, we see a smooth rise to the highest point, and then a straight line to the end. The top parallel of a square is parallel to the bottom one. In contrast, with a Coffin, after the rise to the highest point, there is a gradual slope down to the tip.

When placing the forms, there are two key differences. The first is called **pinching the form**. When we place the form on the nail, we pinch it into shape. For a Square, the form is pinched into an even tube; it doesn't taper or widen. We see two perfectly parallel lines. But when we place the form for a Coffin, we pinch the end of the form much tighter, causing it to taper.

The depth of the C-curve also depends on how much you pinch the form. The tighter the pinch, the deeper the C-curve.

But if we go back to the picture, we’ll notice that the Coffin form was pinched, and the Square form was not, yet its C-curve is deeper. Why is that? It's because the C-curve also depends on another factor: the **direction of the form**.

So, if I draw a straight line on the Coffin from the natural free edge to the future free edge, we see that both edges lie on the same line and that the form's side markings are parallel to the lateral axis. This means we used **straight placement** for the Coffin.

However, if I move that form over to the Square, we see that the free edge of the square sits higher than the natural nail's edge. To achieve this, the form must be angled **upwards**.

These are the different placement directions for different nail shapes. So, while the Coffin used straight placement, the Square used **upward placement**. The shorter the square, the higher you'll need to angle the form; the longer it is, the less you'll angle it. You can place the form straight for a Square, but it will result in a sloped architecture like a Coffin and a less pronounced C-curve. **Downward placement should never be used for a Square.**

If you angle the form upwards for a Coffin, you’ll still get a Coffin shape since you're pinching it, but it will have a straighter architecture like a Square and a deeper C-curve. The arch will be more of a half-oval than a half-circle. I personally don't like this look, which is why I use straight placement for Coffin.

Now let's break down the **Almond**. An Almond has a gentle rise to the highest point and a smooth slope down to the free edge. If we look at an Almond from the side, we see it has a completely straight lower parallel that extends to the middle of the free edge, just like a Square. Note that it doesn't curve down; it's straight up to this point, and only after the midpoint of the free edge does a gentle curve up to the tip begin.

While the forms for Square and Coffin are not creased in any way (they have a smooth loop at the end), for an Almond, we need to **crease the form into a triangle shape** at the tip. This crease point should always be exactly two grid units away from your intended final length.

When applying gel for Almond and Stiletto shapes, we sculpt with minimal excess length. For example, if our target length is 5.5, I will apply the gel to a maximum of 6. When sculpting a Square or Coffin, we add an excess of one full grid unit. Why this extra length? In my technique, we file most of the gel away from the side edges, which can leave the corners of a square very weak if built to the exact length. So we add extra material, and when we file it down, we end up with a sharp, strong free edge with durable corners. We are essentially filing our way to the strength.

You can also place the form for an Almond **slightly downward**. The only difference will be that this upward curve at the tip will be less pronounced.

Next up are **Stilettos**. The form for a Stiletto is placed either **far downward** or **slightly downward**. If you place a Stiletto form straight, the nail will look like it's taking off. I won't even mention trying to place a stiletto form upward.

Technically, for a classic Stiletto, the tip of the nail and the entire lower parallel should be on the same level as the growth points. To achieve this, you need to angle the form very far down. I'm not a big fan of this because a huge mass of gel ends up on the free edge, giving the nail a downward-growing architecture, which cracks easily at the stress points. That's why I prefer to place the form for a stiletto just slightly lower than straight. This gives the lower parallel a subtle arc shape. While the classic stiletto's lower parallel is perfectly straight, this one has a curve that is barely visible to the eye, but the nail's architecture is much better. Plus, if a person has downward-growing nails, the classic stiletto will immediately look hooked, while my version will appear straight for much longer. My method shifts some of the gel onto the nail plate, strengthening it, whereas the classic placement leaves very little gel there.

The Stiletto form also needs a crease. It should be made about a millimeter past the intended length. If you make it further away, you'll end up with a... well, a blunt stiletto. If you make the crease with no extra room and build the gel right up to it, the tip will chip and split when you start filing, and it will be a pain to fix. So, always leave a small margin.

Now, let's talk about my favorite shape, the **Ballerina**, and how it differs from a Coffin. A Ballerina is not a Coffin. Look here: this is a Coffin. From the top view, it has straight parallels that taper to the tip. A Ballerina, on the other hand, has curved, arc-shaped parallels. They also taper towards each other, but they are rounded, whereas a Coffin's are straight. I always say that a Ballerina is just a clipped Stiletto. It has a straight lower parallel, a sloped architecture, and a very flat C-curve.

Forms for a Ballerina are placed just like for a Stiletto: slightly lower than straight. We just saw that a Ballerina has straight parallels from a side view, so how do they appear curved from the top? I'll tell you right away that filing does play a part, but not a huge one. The secret is this: when we place a form for a Ballerina, **we create a crease in the form**.

This is what a form without a crease looks like, for a Coffin, for example. When you look at it from above, its sidelines taper, but they are straight. But if we make a crease, the lines immediately start to curve. This is how a Ballerina gets its curved side parallels from the top view, while they remain straight from the side view. So yes, we also crease the form for a Ballerina. How far from the end should you make the crease? It's really a matter of taste, but it's usually about four grid units away. How close you make the crease to the intended length will determine how narrow the tip will be. The closer the crease, the narrower the tip; the farther away, the wider.

Now let's look at **upward-growing** and **downward-growing nails**. The only difference from straight nails is how you adjust the form placement. If for a straight nail we place a Ballerina form slightly down, then for a downward-growing nail, we would place it straight. Meanwhile, for an upward-growing nail, it would be placed even lower... well, we'll discuss the theory of that now.

So, for downward-growing nails, we place the forms slightly higher than what I've just described. However, for upward-growing nails, the situation is a bit different. You cannot place the form for upward-growing nails up or down. You can only adhere to a **straight placement**, or angle it just slightly up or slightly down from there. The idea that you can't do stilettos on upward-growing nails is a total myth. You just place the form slightly downward... yes, from the side view, the nail will point up a bit, but they will still be stilettos and look sexy. And frankly, even if you do squares on upward-growing nails, people with this nail type often have an upturned final phalanx, so no matter what shape you create, it will look tilted up. So just do what you want, but stick to a generally straight placement.

Also, notice a peculiar feature of upward-growing nails: even with a straight form placement, they will still have a C-curve.

Regarding downward-growing nails, I want to tell you right away: if a person's nails are all straight, their index finger will almost certainly be a downward-growing one. And if a person's nails are all upward-growing, their index finger will be straight. The index finger has a growth direction that is slightly lower than all the other fingers; this is also common with thumbs. Keep this in mind during extensions so that you maintain the same C-curve depth and direction on all the nails. A very common beginner mistake is that their index fingers turn out lower and flatter—this is exactly why. They place the form on the index finger the same way as on the others, but it's not the same and won't look the same.

I also want to discuss one more point with you in theory right now. Look at this nail – this is how the **substrate**, or initial thin layer, should look. It should look as if the nail just grew out straight like this on its own. How do you achieve that? Well, first, we will always level the substrate by turning the finger upside down, but that's not enough.

Notice that the natural nail also has this rise to a highest point and then a slope down. We need to find this highest point on the natural nail and brush the gel over the entire nail starting from that highest point. Then, when you do the self-leveling with the builder gel, you will have the correct flow paths. Because if you start, let's say, a grid unit further down, you will have a dip right here, and you won't get a straight nail—you'll just have a dip. And if you start with too much of a margin in the other direction, you'll have a hump here. So, find the highest point and work from there.

Another very common mistake happens when you want to do a no-file extension but end up having to file a lot. When you level the substrate, I repeat, you should have a perfectly straight line. If it's a stiletto, you should have a perfectly straight line here. The hardest time to get a straight line is with upward form placement because there will be a break, a sort of pit, between the nail and the form that needs to be filled. If you don't level out this pit properly from the start, your substrate will have this shape, with a dip in the middle. You won't be able to do a no-file extension here. If you try to level this with a second layer without filling that pit first, you'll have to file down the entire nail afterward to even it out because builder gel won't self-level properly over a dip like that.

And now for one of my favorite topics: what is the **apex**, and where is it located? In my in-person classes, I constantly ask students to show me the apex, and they point to this spot right here. This is not the apex. This is the **highest point**.

The **apex** is the thickest part of the nail. The apex must protect the nail in the **stress area**. The stress area is the line drawn between the two growth points. If you press on the tip of the nail, this is the line that will turn white. This is the weakest part of the nail, and it needs reinforcement. So the apex, if we look at a cross-section, is located here... The apex is located at the **butt joint** where the extension meets the natural nail.

The only exception is on upward-growing nails. Due to their plate structure, their apex shifts to... well, to where the highest point is. They coincide. This is the only case where this spot is also the apex.

**HYPONYCHIUM**

Now, I'll show you that releasing the hyponychium is very quick and not at all scary.

First, I file the free edge length down to zero and then immediately tilt the file against it, like this.

And there it is.

This is what the nail looks like before the release. The nail bed appears slightly elongated, which makes it difficult to cut and fit the form.

And this is what it looks like after it's been released. Now the free edge is no longer elongated, and cutting the form will be easier.

Try doing this on yourself first to understand how to avoid causing pain and to get a feel for what it is.

Of course. Here is the shortened text translated into English, optimized for a tutorial voiceover.

**COFFIN**

Before placing the form, I straighten the client's finger. I slide the form underneath and immediately eyeball where I need to cut the notches and how deep they should be. It's crucial that there are no gaps between the form and the nail; the form's curve must perfectly support the natural arch.

I cut symmetrical notches, then roll the form along the C-curve and fit it. To guide it into place correctly, I press one corner in, then the other. For a coffin shape, you need straight placement, so it's important to maintain this angle from the very first fitting, otherwise, the cutouts won't align.

After peeling the form, I grip it by its side ribs, place it, and first stick the wings onto the finger to pull the form snugly into place. Then, I perfectly align and stick the bottom tabs together; if they're crooked, the arch will be too. I check that the form is straight and then pinch it to the finger so it doesn't move. From the top, the form should not be any wider or narrower than the growth points. Since this is a coffin, I taper the tip to my desired narrowness.

To visually straighten the nail, I place the form between the central axis of the finger and the axis of the nail itself.

I apply a thin slip layer of gel, making sure to cover the growth points. Next, I build the substrate: first, a thin layer starting from the nail's highest point, then I use a small bead to separately fill in the growth point areas. Now I take a larger bead, place it at the butt joint with the natural nail, and immediately extend it to the desired length, leaving about one grid unit of extra length for a coffin.

From this same bead, I build out the side parallels. I spread the gel with long strokes, barely touching the surface, and immediately turn the finger upside down. In the inverted position, the nail's parallels should be parallel to the table, and the gel will self-level perfectly. One stroke with the brush from the tip to the cuticle is enough. Remember: only lift the brush at the butt joint, so that the most material stays there.

Before curing, I check that the form hasn't loosened from the heat. I remove the form by carefully pulling it downwards.

After removing the sticky layer, I begin filing. I always start with the length, placing the file perpendicularly to create a straight free edge. Next, I file the lower parallels, holding the file as an extension of the finger's lateral axis. I like to file the lower parallel and the side wall at the same time.

Next is the builder gel application. For a perfect light reflection, it's essential to apply a flawless, thin slip layer first, especially near the sinuses and side walls.

I tilt the nail downwards. I take a large bead of gel, place it in the center, and without lifting the brush, I nudge the gel towards the cuticle and sinuses, always bringing the bulk of the gel back to the center. Then I guide a line down to the free edge and distribute it to the sides before turning the finger upside down for the final leveling.

After curing, I do a little touch-up filing on the sides to restore the sharpness that a coffin shape often loses during the leveling stage. I place the file at a 90-degree angle to the nail and redefine the side wall.

I cover it with a top coat, applying it in a self-leveling layer as close as possible to the cuticle and sides. I cure for 2 minutes for a long-lasting shine. Before curing, I always turn the nail upside down for a few seconds to perfect the light reflection. After the top coat, I give the free edge and lower parallels one final file for maximum crispness.

And here is the result. On a well-structured nail, the light reflection is a thin, straight line, not a round spot.


**SQUARE**

I take a form to size it. It's already rolled for the C-curve, so I just fold back the wings.

I slide it under the nail, immediately setting it at an upward angle to see where I need to cut. To determine the depth of the cutouts, you need to connect the growth points with a line and drop a perpendicular line down from the center—that will be your depth.

For the middle finger in the last video, I measured a bit wider than the second line from the center. This is the ring finger, which is usually a bit narrower, and it lines up perfectly with the second line.

After checking, I peel the form off, touching the sticky side only once, and regrip it by the side ribs.

I place the form, remembering to keep the upward angle. I stick the wings onto the finger, then immediately stick the bottom tabs together perfectly tip-to-tip. If I overlap them, the C-curve will get twisted.

To determine how much to angle the form up, I visualize a line from the future highest point of the nail. This line should intersect the form exactly where I plan the free edge to be, or slightly before it. Don't over-pinch the tip of the form, either when fitting or placing it. For a square, it should form a straight tube.

I find the highest point of the natural nail and apply a thin slip layer starting from there, keeping one side of my brush clean. Then, I fill in the growth point areas.

Now I take a larger bead of gel, place it at the butt joint, and extend it to my desired length, leaving extra for filing. From that same bead, I form the parallels. Since my forms have markings for upward placement, I use those as a guide. If your forms don't have these, draw your parallels by "crossing over" the straight-placement grid lines to ensure the nail doesn't angle upwards.

Now, I place a large bead at the butt joint, guide it down, spread it out a bit, and turn the hand over. I just held the finger parallel to the table, and the gel leveled itself out.

I get asked a lot about pinching. I don't normally pinch my nails, but if I messed something up, I might pinch with curved tweezers like these. Whatever you use, you must do it on gel that has set but is not fully cured, and you should pinch at the growth points to narrow the butt joint. You can also do it along the length if something needs correcting. Well, I have nothing to pinch here. After pinching, you must immediately finish curing.

Carefully remove the form by pulling it downwards.

First, file a crisp free edge so you don't have to return to it. I'm filing on myself, so the nail moves a bit no matter how I hold it. On a client, you need to secure the finger firmly.

When filing the parallels, I place the file flat right under the nail, periodically checking my work against the lateral axis of the finger. I inspect the nail. All of its shape imperfections are now only on the surface.

I place the file on the side at a 90-degree angle so I can see the entire nail and where it makes contact with the file. Now I'm filing only the side wall and the top surface. If you see the lower parallel is drooping, okay, correct it, but the file should not dip down between the side and the bottom.

Another important point: many people make this motion without noticing when they file and end up taking off the corner. It happens at the end of a stroke when you sort of wipe the file against the corner. It's a subtle movement, but it ruins the corner. Please, exit your filing of sharp lines just as sharply. And when you file the side like this, use a top-to-bottom motion, because going the other way, the file contacts the lower part of the nail first, removing what you need and leaving what you don't. For the same reason, you can't file diagonally near the corners. Keep the file as straight as possible, because the main contact happens where the movement originates.

This is the substrate we've created. Now, let's thoroughly remove the dust in two stages.

We apply a slip layer ("wet floor"). Turn the hand to the side to ensure you coat everything along the walls perfectly so you don't waste time fixing mistakes later. The slip layer is the most critical step for self-leveling, so apply it meticulously with rubbing motions.

Now I take a large bead of gel, without lifting the brush. Towards the sinuses—back to center. Towards the cuticle—back to center. The bulk of the gel always stays in the middle. The tip of the nail points down to help the gel flow there.

Guide the gel down and lift the brush. Smooth out the sides and turn the hand upside down.

The parallels are parallel to the table. I didn't have enough material on the tip, so I grab some from the high point, guide it to the tip, and then move back to the butt joint. That's where I lift the brush, leaving a larger bead of material.

I've already cured it, and it's time to add some sharpness to the sides, but first, let's dive into filing theory.

This is how you hold the file when filing the free edge and the left lower parallel. The grip changes slightly for the parallel, but the principle is the same. When filing parallels on any shape, hold the file as an extension of the finger's lateral axis and be especially careful that it doesn't file into the growth point, or you will file it away. Guide the file straight under the nail and watch the growth point.

For the right parallel, I use this grip, with the file resting on my index finger. An important point: if you want to file straight lines, your whole arm moves from the elbow; your wrist is locked. But when we file curved lines, we work with the wrist and fingers while the elbow is locked.

Surface filing is done with this grip. It creates a rounded surface, and this is where the wrist does the work.

Never hold the file by the very end, because it will wobble and round out the lines. We need a crisp free edge, so hold the file firmly with all your fingers. Never file parallels in that grip, because the file is unstable and impossible to control. Even if you grip it tighter, you'll either put too much pressure on the tip, or the growth point will be the first thing to make contact. With my grip, the file doesn't wobble at all and it's very easy to control what it's doing.

Another important point: we use these short, sweeping motions when we need to lightly smooth something. And we file like this—without lifting and with pressure—when you need to seriously file something down.

Let's get back to our square. Looking at it from above, we see small bulges at the corners. We redefine the shape as I mentioned earlier: place the file at a 90-degree angle and file only the side wall, going slightly onto the top surface. I didn't angle the form very high, so the architecture came out a bit sloped, and I decided to correct it. Good. I noticed another little bump.

For free edges and surfaces, I also like to use these large files. The main rule is: straight side for straight lines, and curved side for curved lines. You can use regular ones, but thicker ones bend less, even if you hold them by the edge. But I still prefer the smaller ones; they're easier to get into tight spots.

The top coat must cover all previous layers. I apply it close to the cuticle and make sure there are no bare spots on the sides. Check along the parallels, too, using the light reflection as your guide. The quality of your work is in the details.

When leveling the top coat, hold your brush as parallel to the nail surface as possible. If you hold it at a steep angle, it will scrape the material towards the free edge like a shovel. Barely touching, use sweeping motions to level it, and then turn the hand upside down.

After the lamp, we'll add a final crispness to the free edge and lower parallels.

And this is the square we end up with. A good C-curve and straight parallels. The width of the tip matches the width at the growth points; it doesn't taper or flare out. The light reflection is in the shape of a thin strip.

Конечно, вот перевод.

**ALMOND**

Now let's create an almond shape with straight form placement.

I determine the width and immediately eyeball the depth.

Since I'm working on the pinky finger, notice that I don't extend the cutouts all the way to the edge of the grid. I end them earlier so they don't get in my way.

I check it—perfect.

I forgot to crease the tip before fitting, so I'm doing it now.

I peel off the form and immediately stick the tip together perfectly edge-to-edge.

I place it, set the direction, stick the wings to the finger, and then perfectly stick the bottom tabs together.

Before pinching the form, I check the direction one last time, and only then do I pinch it to prevent it from flaring out.

I'm making a size 6, so I'm creasing it exactly at the 8 mark. Check the crease using the light reflection to make sure it's in the right spot.

And I push out any air bubbles from underneath. The main thing is not to over-pinch the C-curve at this stage.

Everything is perfect for me.

I apply the substrate, brushing the gel from the highest point of the nail and immediately filling in the growth points. Try to apply it in the straightest line possible on the nail plate and don't pile on a lot of gel. The transition should be seamless.

Now I take a bead of gel and place it directly at my desired length, with about a millimeter of extra, and then I guide it back up to the butt joint.

After that, I immediately form the upward curve and the parallel. The parallel should be straight until about the halfway point—it's better to leave extra material. Then, there's a gentle upward curve towards the tip, with a bit of a droop, leaving us something to file away later.

I take a large bead, place it at the butt joint, and let gravity do the leveling.

I make sure to remove the form by pulling it downwards, pinching it together under the growth points first. I didn't fully cure the gel mix, so the underside isn't perfect.

I file the length. For an almond, it's important to tilt the file under the free edge to immediately create a rounded line. I file with a slight rocking motion to shape the upward curve right away.

Next, the parallels. If the gel has flooded a growth point, first free the skin, then bring the file in from underneath, and only then start filing. The parallels should be perfectly straight, just like on a square. I like to define the side wall at the same time.

Find the approximate midpoint of the free edge. The area from there to the tip is our "lift zone." We file it from underneath with the same rocking motions. Since the lines are curved, I'm working with my wrist. Watch how I instantly lock my wrist when I switch back to the straight parallel and then unlock it again.

Time to refine the nail shape. The principle is the same: up to the midpoint of the free edge, we file straight, tapering lines on the sides. I don't have much to file here since I already did it with the parallels. And from the midpoint, we taper the nail to the tip using rounded lines, filing only the side wall. For an almond, it's crucial that all the surface filing mirrors the lines of the lower free edge.

I apply the slip layer, paying extra close attention to the sidewalls. I really work it in with rubbing motions, turning the nail to the side, and I check my work with the light reflection.

I take a bead and place it in the center of the plate. I nudge it towards the cuticle—back to center. Towards the sidewalls—back to center. I center the bead and then guide it down. I smooth it out a bit and turn the hand over. If you need to do some leveling while it's inverted, be sure to guide the gel away from the tip so the nail doesn't end up with a hump, and keep the parallels parallel to the table.

Perfect. Nothing to file.

The top coat should cover all the previous layers, so I apply it thoroughly. Cure for 2 minutes.

I did a little filing, just for the sake of it.

And this is the almond we've created. A straight, thin line of light reflection, which shows that the nail is perfectly structured.

Of course. Here is the translation.

**STILETTO**

I decided to also share how to create a nail just for a video.

I take a peel-off base like this one and coat the entire nail, including the free edge, and I get it on the side walls. Mine are high, so I sort of "unstick" them like this so the base seeps in deeper and doesn't get frayed during the process. After the first layer dries, I repeat. For some reason, I sometimes have issues with just one layer. I applied a gel polish base coat first, but you can do this on a bare nail too; it actually seems to come off better that way.

The form for a stiletto should be placed angled down, but since I'm using forms designed specifically for stilettos, we'll be using this wonderful grid marking as our guide. I place the form like this. The marking on the form is almost parallel to the lateral axis, but it still goes a tiny bit higher. This will give us a straighter architecture on top and a stronger nail.

I measured by eye and start cutting the notches. I'm cutting the deeper part in a non-standard way, widening it, because my free edge is flatter than the pre-cut notch on the form.

I check it. By the way, if you place it perfectly parallel to the axis, the top will be more sloped and it will start to look hooked much faster. I'm placing it slightly higher than the straight marking. The template fits perfectly.

I peel off the form, touch the sticky part once, and immediately stick the tip together—perfectly edge-to-edge, of course.

I place the form, attach the wings to the finger, and stick everything together perfectly edge-to-edge so the nail doesn't get crooked.

I check from the side. I adjust it a bit from the top, check that it's straight from another angle too, and then pinch the form to the finger.

I make the crease a millimeter past my intended length, which for me will be a size 4. And I push out the air bubble into the pinched area as well. The C-curve of the nail is perfectly supported.

I find the highest point of the natural nail plate and, starting from there, I apply a slip layer over the entire nail, with no extra material. With tiny beads of gel, I meticulously work on the growth points.

I take a large bead, place it at the butt joint, and extend it to the end of the length. And from there, I immediately draw out the parallels. It came out quite even, so I just turn it upside down and wait, without touching it with the brush.

A nice one.

Before removing the form, I check the growth points and the parallels. Everything is super for me.

I pinch the form under the growth points and carefully peel it off downwards. As you can see, there's almost nothing to file here.

I file the length just like with an almond, tilting the file under the free edge. And right from there, I file a slightly rounded parallel towards the tip, like this. So, our task is to connect the growth point and the tip with one, sligh-h-h-tly arched line.

Now I look at the tip. All the puffiness on it is now only on the surface, so I place the file perfectly on the side—it's important not to tilt it under the parallel—and I define a sharp point.

Just what I needed.

Next, I look at the overall shape and perfect everything on the sides as well.

Leveling.

I take a small bead of gel and apply the slip layer. Thoroughly, along the nail folds and parallels. Don't leave any dry spots. I hope these phrases will appear in your dreams later.

When everything is perfectly coated, we take a large bead and place it in the center of the natural nail. With this motion, I kind of form the bead and then let it flow onto the nail.

Without lifting the brush, I nudge the gel towards the nail folds, one after the other. I gather it back into a ball and then guide it down in a single strip. It's okay to lift the brush now. I finish the sides with these long movements, and then flip it over.

If you have a very runny gel and it's pooling in the center, just hold the finger in the normal position for a moment to let it spread to the sides, and then still turn it upside down for a few seconds before curing.

It came out perfectly.

This is what the parallels of a stiletto should look like. They are rounded, but it's not obvious. The highest point is in the center of the nail plate, the apex follows right after it and doesn't stand out. The nail is sloped, but again, it's not noticeable. And yes, a stiletto does have a C-curve.

Now it's time to take this off. I take nail polish remover. I soak a stick in it and start prying up that base coat along the nail folds. The process isn't instant, of course, but it's satisfying. From the inside, too. As soon as some lifting appears, I pour the liquid into the gaps, and... that's all.

Of course. Here is the translation.

**ACRYGEL**

I'm fitting the form for sizing. I eyeballed the depth; the width is 2.5—a standard ring finger.

I roll the form for the C-curve, fold back the wings, and try it on.

I can see the notches are sticking out by about half a millimeter.

I trimmed it, and now it's perfect.

I'm going to do a super lazy square: short with straight placement.

For squares, I always hold the form closer to the growth points, not by the tip.

I stuck the wings to the finger and then perfectly stuck the bottom tabs together.

I check the direction, and only then do I pinch the form to the finger.

With a moistened stick, I pick up a bead of Acrygel.

I place it at the butt joint and adjust it so that it's actually a bead.

If I were to just smash the bead with the stick in this position, it would just squeeze out on all sides. Our goal is to use the stick to block the Acrygel's path where we want a smooth transition. We press, and we get a smooth line on the cuticle side, while it squeezes out evenly on the other sides.

Keeping the stick in the same position, we create a smooth transition with small patting motions.

Let's start over. I take a normal-sized bead and place it at the butt joint. If I just mindlessly press it, it will squeeze out at the sides. So, I find the highest point, place the tip of my stick there, and form a smooth transition over the entire surface, making sure to cover the growth points thoroughly. The stick should always be moistened in slip solution.

We already have an even surface, so we don't poke at it. We don't do this either. Now, holding the stick flat, we gradually extend the material to the end of the nail, shaping the parallels as we go.

The same goes for a brush. Don't dig like this; you'll create a pit. I also hold my brush flat. You can do this without a brush, but I like to use it for the final smoothing and to feather the material to nothing. Try not to work backward with the brush unless absolutely necessary. You can always pick up any excess.

Cure.

It's very important that when spreading the Acrygel, there are no bulges when viewed from the free edge.

I rested my hand on the form in the lamp and it created a step. That's another point against Acrygel.

I remove the inhibition layer and file a crisp free edge.

Looking at the free edge, I see a small bump has appeared on the right.

After the free edge, I file the parallels. The file is positioned perfectly underneath. Acrygel is a less durable material than gel, so you need to be very careful when filing substrates made from it, constantly supporting the nail.

I look from above and see that the right wall is flaring out, and the whole nail looks like a shovel. I place the file perfectly on the side and use it to define a straight wall. After that, I refine everything on the surface that's bugging me.

I check the parallels to make sure there are no dips or excess material. From the top view, I'm happy with it now, too.

I thoroughly remove the dust; it's more annoying from Acrygel than from gel.

I apply the slip layer, as always, super thoroughly and with rubbing motions.

I pick up a bead, always keeping the bulk in the center, and distribute it using the same pattern: to the cuticle—back to center; to the sinus—back to center. If the client has high sidewalls, you can also distribute it to the sides before guiding it down.

I level it slightly and turn the hand over. There's nothing for the brush to do here.

After curing, we check the shape. It's basically good, but I can always find something to nitpick. The distance between the corners on the free edge is slightly wider than the distance between the growth points. A square is a parallel shape, and everything about it should be parallel, so I refine the sidewalls.

Now it doesn't bug me. I'm not going to apply a top coat—I'm lazy.

Of course. Here is the text shortened by about 10%, making it slightly more concise by removing minor redundancies while keeping the full instructional detail.

**HIGH-SPEED**

This is a high-speed technique, so correct form placement is the foundation. On my first attempt, I made a mistake: I didn't cut deep enough, and the notches didn't reach the growth points.

Let's correct that. I'm deepening the cut and adjusting the notches as needed.

I peel off the form and immediately stick the tip together perfectly straight. I place it, stick the wings to the finger, and then secure the bottom tabs, watching the form's direction at every stage. I'm making a size 5 length, so I'm creasing the form at the 7 mark.

I check everything one last time before pinching the form to the finger, because you can't adjust it after it's pinched.

We will build the nail in a single layer, so we start with a generous bead and place it in the center of the nail plate. Don't forget to moisten the stick. We'll form a smooth transition near the cuticle, distributing the product along all the sidewalls.

I distribute the material smoothly step by step: one step down, spread across the width, another step down, and so on. The goal is to create a good architecture and shape right away without digging into the material. An almond has a sloped architecture, so the closer you are to the tip, the more you angle the stick onto its back end. Near the highest point, you hold it flatter.

Using a brush for final smoothing is optional, but I find it helpful. Notice how I've already sculpted both the parallel and the upward curve to be almost finished. I'm lightly pressing with the belly of the brush to smooth this bump downwards. This is a very good result; time to cure.

Now for the filing. Tilting the file under the free edge, I use a rocking motion to immediately form a rounded line. Next, I file the straight parallels, always using the lateral axis of the finger as a guide. I work in an assembly-line style—free edge on all nails, then one parallel, then the other—as it's faster. From the midpoint of the free edge, I shape a smooth upward curve to the tip.

It's already looking good, but we will do a surface file. First, I file a flat plane in the center of each nail, sloping down from the highest point. Then, I file down and smooth out the ridges that formed on the sides. When refining, remember that for an almond, the top shape should mirror the side profile. So, up to the midpoint, I define two straight, tapering lines, and from the midpoint on, I smooth them into a rounded tip.

Since this is a high-speed, one-step technique, choose colored Acrygels that you can apply neatly in a single layer.

We cover it with a top coat and admire the result. I'm just going to make the sides a bit straighter from the top view, as they aren't quite even enough for me.
